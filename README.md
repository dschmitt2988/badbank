Project Title: Bad Bank Three Tier Application

Description/Motivation: The bad bank assignment is an assignment for the MIT Coding Bootcamp that allows users to experience creating a three-tiered banking application.  It involves a front-end browser API, connecting to a Node.js server, routes using Express, and a MongoDB database running from a dockerized container.  The "bad" in the bad bank comes from the lack of security.  

Installation Guidelines: Clone the repository and all the files into a directory, without changing any of hierarchy in the files in the other directories. Open a terminal at the directory and run npm install.  Then run node index.js.  Terminal will give a port number (default port 3000) that your API will be running on.  Open localhost:3000 to view the bad bank application.

Technology used: Node.js, Express, CORS, MongoDB 

Features: Simple banking app, allows creation of users.  Will add authentication in the future.
